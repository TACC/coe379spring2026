================ CMake

For your homeworks you need to create folders with solely:

- your sources
- a CMakeLists.txt file 

with this, your instructor will do this:

- we pull updates of your repo
- then we do the following sequence:

## for C:
rm -rf build # delete build directory if any
mkdir build  # make build directory
cd build     # go there
CC=${TACC_CC} cmake ../hw-in-c
make
ibrun your_executable

## for C++ (both cxx & mpl)
rm -rf build
mkdir build
cd build
CXX=${TACC_CXX} cmake ../hw-with-mpl # or cxx
make
ibrun your_executable

Obviously you should do the same thing
to make sure your submission works.
However, do not submit your build directory
or other temporaries & binaries.

To get you started there are 3 example directories
here with cmake setup files.
