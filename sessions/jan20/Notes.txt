================ In class:

- go into the exercises-mpi-xxx directory
  where xxx is your favorite flavor
- do "idev" to get an interactive node

idev -N 2 -n 12 # 2 nodes, 12 cores total

For class: 

idev -m 70 # 70 minutes

If there is a reservation, use it.
If there is no reservation, you may have to wait for an interactive node.

================ Languages

MPI has interfaces for the following languages:
C - defined by the standard
Fortran - defined by the standard
Python - 3rd party project
C++ (1) you can use the C interface
    (2) you can the C++ interface from MPL

These directories exist:

exercises-mpi-c : use the C language
exercises-mpi-p : python
exercises-mpi-f08 : fortran
exercises-mpi-cxx : use C++ but with the C interface to MPI
exercises-mpi-mpl : use C++ with the C++ interface from MPL

================ MPL

On frontera, do

module load intel/23
module load mpl

to get MPL available.

If you now do 

module save 

you automatically get them next time you log in.
