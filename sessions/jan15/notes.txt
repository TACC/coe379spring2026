==== User guide

It's a good idea to find the frontera user guide
and read through it.

tacc.utexas.edu > systems > frontera > user guide

==== Login & compute nodes

When you login:

ssh yourname@frontera.tacc.utexas.edu

you wind up on a `login node':

login1.frontera.tacc.utexas.edu # or 2,3,4

You share this with many other users so don't run production.
Instead:

idev # interactive compute node

We demonstrated the use of a jobscript

sbatch jobscript # batch job
squeue -u yourname # see status
watch squeue -u yourname # see status updated every 2 seconds

The jobscript needs your project account. Use: ASC25001

To see all your account information:

/usr/local/etc/taccinfo

==== File systems

Frontera has three file systems:
- $HOME : small, but permanent and nightly backed up
- $WORK : big, permanent, not backed up
- $SCRATCH : big, regularly purged

The WORK file system is actually `$STOCKYARD/frontera':
`STOCKYARD' is available on each cluster.

So you could create your work in HOME but if you put
it in STOCKYARD, it makes it easier to move between clusters.
Up to you.

==== Unix-isms

Commands today:
- hostname : name of the machine you're on
- who : who is on this machine
- wc : `word count'

idiom:

who | wc -l # count how many people are on this machine

Command history:

!foo : last commandline that started with `foo'
!?foo? : last commandline that contained `foo'
!foo:p : display last commandline &c
!! : repeat previous command, for instance after you used the :p option
